It arises most frequently from the acoustic nerve. Bilateral acoustic schwannomas are characteristic of neurofi bromatosis
it consists of small fi rm papules/ papule either fl esh coloured or pink usually on the face and neck.
"It generally presents as  a collection of pink, red or dusky brown, fi rm dermal nodules  of varying size but usually less than 15  mm diameter"
"it has a predilection for the proximal extremities, followed by the trunk"
"It has a round or oval shape, with a  diameter of a few – usually up to 10 – centimetres. Normally it  presents as a single lesion, but multiple Mongolian spots may  occasionally occur"
"It is also associated with UV exposure,  gaining a darker shade after exposure to sunlight (e.g. after  a summer vacation) or artificial UV sources"
"It is at first smooth, dome-shaped  and acutely tender."
It is characterized by 2–15  mm yellow  or reddish yellow papules/plaques affecting both the skin and  mucous membranes. The back and head are the most common  locations
