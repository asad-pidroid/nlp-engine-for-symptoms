Common warts around the nails, especially at the nail folds or  beneath the nail, can disturb nail growth.
commonest local infection in infancy is periumbilical, with  a foul-smelling bluish green discharge and spreading erythema
commonest sites affected are the cheeks, nose, ears and back  of hands . As the vesicles resolve, haemorrhagic crusting develops and as this detaches, varioliform scarring  remains and can be severe
commonest sites,  the area of the frenulum, corona and glans in men, and the posterior fourchette in women, correspond to the likely sites of greatest  coital friction
Commonly affected  sites include the lips, genitals, palms and soles; 5% of cases may  have an exclusive mucosal involvement
Commonly, one or more lesions appear at the anus or on the buttocks and spread as sloughing coalescing ulcers
Communication with the cranial cavity is present in up to  20% of cases.

In 20% of cases, there is an association with lymphangiomatosis
In 39–60% of  patients, the mucous membranes are affected, with particular involvement of the lips, pharynx, larynx, conjunctivae and  bronchus
In 40% of patients, presentation is with the  painless enlargement of one or more groups of superfi cial lymph  nodes.
In bullous impetigo, the bullae are less rapidly ruptured and  become much larger; a diameter of 1–2 cm is common but they  may be of very considerable size, and persist for 2 or 3 days
In chronic ulcers, the margin is heaped up,  often giving the appearance of a rolled border, and has an irregular surface
In diffuse keratodermas, the whole of the palmar or plantar epidermis, usually including the centripalmar skin and the instep, is uniformly  thickened
In focal, areate or nummular keratoderma, the areas of palmoplantar skin under most pressure are disproportionately thickened
In infants, it may present as a resistant napkin eruption with yellowish and sometimes purpuric lesions. In adults, the lesions are papular, and scarring and ulceration may be prominent.
In Late onchocerciasis,  Atrophy of skin and damage to supporting tissue  cause the skin to sag in folds (lizard skin)
In males, lesions tend to be larger  and may be related to a hydrocele or a hernia
In men, involvement of the presternal area is typical with petaloid (petal-shaped)  lesions that may be localized
In men, the chancre most usually occurs on the glans penis, near  the frenulum or on the underside of the prepuce
In more chronic forms, the lesions are typically  clustered into plaques, especially on the upper lip and chin
In patients who are receiving drugs with sympathomimetic effects
in patients with clinically significant bleeding or who are at risk for bleeding
in patients with mechanical prosthetic heart valves
In patients with raised catecholamine concentrations
In severe attacks, purpuric lesions and crusted erosions or vesicles may occur
In severe neglected cases, pus and exudate  may produce matting of the hair
In skin, patchy and irregular brownish grey pigmentation and/or nodules of the face, upper chest and shoulders have been reported and may cause disfigurement
In tarsal conjunctiva papillae arranged in a ‘cobble-stone’ or ‘pavement stone’, fashion along with conjunctival hyperemia
In the acute phase the lesions are  dull red, very exudative or crusted and highly pruritic
In the bone, the lesions are focal, destructive,  lytic and may become widespread with associated hypercalcaemia
In the eye,  white stippled deposits may be observed at the margins of the  fovea or macula, with discoloration of the macular region
in the severely ill or in compromised neutropenic patients, primary cutaneous invasion with  extensive necrosis may develop around a local erosion
In vestibulodynia, there will be touch-provoked tenderness over the vestibule when pressure is applied with a cotton-tipped swab (the touch test). This is usually at a maximum between 5 and 7 o’clock,
In women most common sites for a vulvar chancre are the  labia minora or majora
In younger patients, solar lentigines are most commonly seen on  sun-exposed sites, such as the face in both sexes and the shoulders  in males. They are macular, tan coloured and may be very large,  w

Involvement of deeper soft tissues and internal organs, including bone,  can be seen. Individual nodules rarely exceed 2–3 cm in diameter
Involvement of other organs,  including the lung, liver and bone, may be seen in some cases, and  it is not clear whether this represents multicentricity or metastatic  spread.
Involvement of the lips and cheeks may be followed by  progressive gangrene
Involvement of the mucous membranes of the eyes, mouth,  nose and genitalia is usually an early feature and leads to an  erosive and haemorrhagic mucositis.
Involvement of the scalp ranges from mild flaking without underlying erythema to a more inflammatory eruption with thicker, yellow, greasy scales and crusts; similar changes can occur in the beard.

It arises most frequently from the acoustic nerve. Bilateral acoustic schwannomas are characteristic of neurofi bromatosis
it consists of small fi rm papules/ papule either fl esh coloured or pink usually on the face and neck.
It generally presents as  a collection of pink, red or dusky brown, fi rm dermal nodules  of varying size but usually less than 15  mm diameter
it has a predilection for the proximal extremities, followed by the trunk
It has a round or oval shape, with a  diameter of a few – usually up to 10 – centimetres. Normally it  presents as a single lesion, but multiple Mongolian spots may  occasionally occur
It is also associated with UV exposure,  gaining a darker shade after exposure to sunlight (e.g. after  a summer vacation) or artificial UV sources
It is at first smooth, dome-shaped  and acutely tender.
It is characterized by 2–15  mm yellow  or reddish yellow papules/plaques affecting both the skin and  mucous membranes. The back and head are the most common  locations
It is distinguished from naevus of Ota by its location  in the area innervated by the posterior supraclavicular and lateral  cutaneous brachial nerves
It is fi rm and rounded  but with rather indefi nite margins, sessile or pedunculated, and  between 5 and 20 mm in diameter
it is found more commonly on the  trunk and the extremities. A compound naevus is a slightly raised, oval or round papule with symmetrical shape
It is rare in young adults and  more exceptional in older adults. The trunk, axilla and groin are  much more commonly involved than the proximal limbs
It is usually of acute onset, with fever, sweats, wasting, generalized painful lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly
It may begin in early adult life with one or more small,  fi rm, painless, fl esh-coloured or red dermal nodules
It may reduce calcium absorption
It presents as an asymptomatic slowly growing mass on the posterior upper trunk
It presents in children and young adults of either sex, with  a predilection for the lower limbs and the head and neck
It presents with asymptomatic, non-scaly, erythematous papules and plaques, mainly affecting the face, neck and upper chest.
It presents with single to multiple papules or nodules  with a predilection for the face, head and neck, followed by the  upper torso and upper and lower extremities.
It then evolves to  form a centrifugally extending, annular, erythematous eruption having a crusted edge which may be itchy, burning, painful, blistered or eroded
It usually  occurs in females, less than 14 months of age, on the proximal  extremity or upper back, and may be misdiagnosed as haemangioma, particularly as it can be preceded by a congenital precurso
It usually appears as a slow-growing small polypoid lesion. Multiple neurofi bromas are rare outside  the setting of neurofi bromatosis type 1
It was first described in children with  significant erythema, scaling and induration of the extremities and  hyperkeratosis on the palms, soles and face. There may be ulceration of the extremities

lesion gradually becomes elevated, infiltrated and brown and grows by slow  peripheral extension to become gyrate or discoid in shape with  areas of atrophy
lesion is a rounded, oval or irregular hypopigmented patch that is usually not well marginated
lesion is an oedematous erythematous follicular papule or pustule centred on a hair
lesion is usually solitary and painful and consists of a  fi rm rounded bluish dermal nodule 3–50 mm in diameter
Lesion number ranges from four to 200
lesion of the gastric mucosa
lesion of the mouth
Lesion site reaction
Lesion start as a small,  indurated, warty papule with a slight inflammatory areola
lesion, which is usually solitary, is often situated around the  eyelids or near the mouth, or occasionally on the genitalia
LESIONS
Lesions  are commonly composed of papules and pustules, often forming verrucous or granulomatous plaques or nodules, which  may ulcerate
Lesions  are longstanding, small, usually less than 1 cm, skin coloured and  asymptomatic.
Lesions are  most commonly central on the face, and single.
Lesions are  most often seen with diabetes or before, during or after  dialysis for renal failure
lesions are commonly seen on neck and on trunk
lesions are dull red, flat or slightly raised maculopapules, which may either remain small or increase in size to reach a diameter of 1–3 cm in 48 h
lesions are found within naevus  sebaceous and trichoblastoma is regarded as the most common neoplasm occurring in this hamartoma
Lesions are itchy papules and pustules, which are often diffusely  scattered on the shoulders and back.
Lesions are less than 1 cm in diameter and present  as papules or dome-shaped nodules. They may occur anywhere on  the body including the genitalia
lesions are macular, sharply  defined and not scaly.
Lesions are more common in uncircumcised men and may be located on the prepuce, frenulum, coronal sulcus, glans penis and penile shaft
Lesions are most common on the elbows, knees and  feet of swimmers, and on the dominant hand
lesions are most commonly seen on the upper body especially on the face, neck, shoulder and arm.
lesions are neither pruritic nor painful, and  sometimes go unnoticed by the patient, primarily involve the trunk and proximal extremities but may involve the hands and face
lesions are non-migratory in nature
Lesions are often  slightly erythematous and have fine scaling
lesions are often confi ned to the face, and are most  common on the cheeks and around the mouth and chin
Lesions are oval, pea-sized flaccid pustules on a normal or erythematous base
Lesions are small (no more than 2  cm  in diameter), longstanding, usually asymptomatic and may  be solitary or, rarely, multiple
lesions are solitary or appear in crops, as small papules of dermal
Lesions are sometimes round or oval and have an atrophic appearance and a yellow red colour
Lesions are subcutaneous, asymptomatic and measure less than 5  cm in diameter. Occasional larger pedunculated  lesions have been reported
Lesions are typically dark blue or purple and may partially blanche when tumid
Lesions are typically painful
Lesions become  hyperplastic and may reach an enormous size, extending from the  nostrils to the pharynx or outwards over the lip
lesions can be recognized as  small raised nodules with two or three hairs protruding together  in a small tuft
Lesions can number as few as 10 or  up to thousands
lesions can occur all over the body but are  most frequently found on the trunk, thighs, buttocks and genitalia
Lesions consist of a papule or nodule presenting in an adult, with  a predilection for the trunk and limbs and, less commonly, involving the face
Lesions first appear as erythematous indurated papules that slowly enlarge to form a ring as the central area flattens and fades
Lesions have been reported mainly from the head and neck area,  including the eyelid and external ear, ano-genital skin and also the  axilla
Lesions in other locations,  including internal organs, are exceptional. Multiple lesions are  usually bilateral and may be sym metrical
lesions include persistent plaques, ulcers, nodules and sinuses. Vaginal lesions may bleed
lesions initially are non-keratotic, soft and bluish-red in colour.
lesions may be acneform, nodular, ulcerated or verrucous
Lesions may be black or dark brown, fl at or cupuliform papules.  They measure 1–5 mm in diameter
lesions may be diffuse,  raised velvety patches bleeding on touch, a whitish patch or  ulcer
lesions may be scarlatiniform, rubelliform or morbilliform, or  may consist of a profuse eruption of small pink papules showing  no close resemblance to any infective exanthem
Lesions may be solitary or multiple, and occur most commonly on the legs (in 70%), but may affect any body site including the genitals and mucosae
lesions may be vesicular or pustular
lesions measure  2–5 mm in diameter and are pearly, flesh-colored, and umbilicated,  with a characteristic dimple at the center.
Lesions occur most commonly in the mouth
lesions occurs most commonly  in the groins, axillae and the intergluteal and submammary flexures
Lesions of EED most commonly appear chronically in a symmetrical fashion over the dorsa of the hands, knees, buttocks and Achilles tendons.Occasionally, the face and ears are also affected by EED
Lesions on the face and neck are generally indistinguishable from  plane warts, but on the trunk and limbs they tend to be larger.
Lesions present as small multiple nodules with a predilection for  the dorsal or dorsolateral aspect of the third, fourth and fi fth digit
Lesions present mainly on the forearms or neck as a small red or  blue circumscribed and asymptomatic plaque.
lesions presents most commonly on the face and trunk
Lesions typically occur in areas prone to stasis, commonly including the ankles and lower legs ., and typically sparing intertriginous regions
Lesions typically occur on  the extremities and are often situated over joints
Lesions usually occur above the waist and particularly around the neck, on the trunk and on the outer aspects of the arms
Less common features are growth retardation, microcephaly, autistic-like behavior, and ocular anomalies

THE CHOLECYSTOSES
The classic skin lesions are  fi rm brown or yellow papules and plaques, which predominantly  affect extensor surfaces, particularly on the hands and forearms
The classic Spitz naevus usually appears as a solitary, firm, symmetrical, sharply demarcated, round or dome-shaped nodule of equal or  less than 5–6 mm diameter on average
The clinical lesions of XD are erythematous, yellow brown papules and nodules, which are symmetrically distributed on the  trunk, scalp, face and proximal extremities
The clinical picture of NXG consists of slowly progressive, reddish yellow, xanthomatous plaques/nodules that are infi ltrative  and destructive
The clinical presentation is not distinctive and lesions appear to have a predilection for the  back.
The colour of the lesion is  pink to red to reddish brown. Firm pressure or diascopy reveals the degree of melanin pigmentation
The common sites are the hands, especially the  fi ngers, the feet, lips, head and upper trunk, and  the mucosal surfaces of the mouth and perianal area
The commonest site is the hands,  particularly the fi ngers, followed by other sites on the extremities  including the head, neck and penis
The commonest situation is the upper extrem ities, particularly the forearm,  but the lesion can occur anywhere, including the orbit and the  mouth
The cutaneous findings are typically erythematous, urticarial papules, which may evolve within 24  h into palpable purpura with haemorrhage.
The cyst is usually unilocular, and contains clear fluid.  Its wall is smooth, thin and translucent
The cyst wall may fuse with the epidermis  to form a crypt, which can occasionally terminate by discharging its content and healing spontaneously
the deep tendon reflexes are absent or diminished
The dermatitis is localized to exposed areas of the skin,  usually with well-demarcated margins where the skin is covered by clothing, for example at the collar and ‘V’ of the neck

The digitate dematosis  is a distinctive form, which consists of fi nger-like projections following dermatomes on the lateral aspects of the chest and abdomen
The disease begins insidiously with one or more erythematous, slightly scaly patches
The disease is characterized by the progressive appearance of  asymptomatic cutaneous lesions with no tendency to spontaneous involution and can result in severe disfi gurement with time
The disease is often limited to the skin, mucosa and joints but  systemic involvement of the heart and other organs has been  described
The disease presents as multiple, symmetrical, small, red-brown  papules on the face, trunk and arms, usually sparing the fl exures
The edge is not usually indurated to the extent that  occurs in SCC. It is characteristic that the hyperplasia will subside  as the ulcer is treated and heals.
The eruption develops in crops and consequently appears polymorphic
The eruption tends to be symmetrical, and  may involve first, or most severely, the site(s) of the original dermatitis, before becoming generalised
The evolution of the eruption  passes through four phases: (i) sensory disturbance with erythema  and oedema on the face and upper trunk; (ii) papulopustular  lesions; (iii) crusting lesions; and (iv)
The extremities are hypotonic
The exudative retinal detachment is smooth and convex

The initial  evolution is rapid, but growth ceases after a few weeks. Spontaneous disappearance is rare. Lesions are not painful; patients mainly  complain of the appearance or of recurrent bleeding
The jugular venous  pulse may show a dominant 'V' wave but there is usually  no venous engorgement.
The labia majora and clitoris are most common sites involved
The late  (tertiary) stage is characterized by gummata of the nasopharynx  that may result in destruction of the nose (gangosa), gummatous  or plaque-like lesions in the skin, periostitis and bony gum
The late form of the disease is commoner, taking the form of  meningitis, occurring a week or two after birth
The latency from drug initiation to onset of rash ranges from 5 to 21  days, but typically occurs at 7–10 days
The latter are characterized by small erythematous papules  disseminated on the trunk and limbs as well as typical prurigo  nodules, mostly located on the shins and arms

The lesions are punctate, dark red to blue-black, and flat or slightly raised
The lesions are typically moist, erythematous plaques. The site of the lesions is important as disease involving the urethra and perianal skin
The lesions may last months or years and often resolve spontaneously but can recur, either at the same or a different site.
The lesions occur most frequently on the ears, bald scalp and  cheeks
The lesions spread over the skin to become large erythematous sheets and individual telangiectasia can be difficult to distinguish
The lesions usually appear insidiously and asymptomatically on the trunk and, to a lesser extent, on the limbs of young adults

The sites of skin involvement are typically flexures and consist of thickened, pendulous  folds
The size varies from a few millimetres to more than 5 cm in diameter and the  lesions may be solitary but are commonly multiple
The skin becomes dry, scaly and thicker as a result of  acanthosis, hyperkeratosis, oedema and cellular infi ltration in the  dermis. Lichenifi cation and fi ssuring may develop later
The skin is adherent to the  mass, which is dermal or subcutaneous, and there may be a central depression with epidermal atrophy or ulceration
The skin over the tumour is normal and the lesion has a  fi rm to stone-hard consistency and a lobular shape on palpation.
The skin reaction develops within minutes to days of taking the  drug. The time to develop the reaction may be slightly longer for  oral than intravenously administered drugs
The skin, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, eye and nervous system  may be involved.
The superfi cial  verrucous plaques vary from dirty yellow to black in colour and  may have a typical ‘stuck-on’ appearance with a loosely adherent  greasy keratin on the surface
The surface of the lesion is smooth,  with a thin, fragile epidermis, often causing bleeding and crusting

Tumours  are large and located in the dermis, subcutis and even deeper soft  tissues.
Tumours  are small, slowly growing and usually asymptomatic. Multiple  lesions are exceptional
Tumours  tend to grow around tendons, are usually less than 3 cm in diameter and are often painful.
Tumours are  slowly growing, and by the time of presentation they are large and  ill defi ned, often measuring 10 cm or more
Tumours are congenital and have been described on the hand,  palate and scalp.
Tumours containing both germ cell and sex cord/gon
Tumours involving only bone and those occurring after infancy are not usually associated with KMP. Cutaneous  tumours are more common on the limbs mainly in areas overlying  the joints
